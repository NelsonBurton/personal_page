<h3>Bitcoin Remittances</h3>

<p>A <%= link_to 'remittance ' ,'http://www.wikipedia.org/Remittance' %> is defined as a worker sending money from the country in which they work to family members and friends in their home country. These payments are typically around $200 per month per worker. Although this seems small, in aggregate, remittances are not insignificant. In many countries remittances are higher than any foreign aid received, and can make up a significant portion of GDP. Some of the largest remittance pathways in the world include US to Mexico ($21.6 billion per year),

<h4>Current remittance flow</h4>

	<h5>Western Union/Money Gram/Xoom</h5>

		<p>You connect your bank account ---> complex network of international transfers between banks

		This existing system of relationships adds complexity and thereby cost to the remittance flow. </p>

	<h5>Informal System - Hawala</h5>

		<p>This system works through a series of informal relationships. Cost is typically around x. Drawbacks:

<h4>Managed Bitcoin remittance system</h4>

	<p>In the Bitcoin remittance market, there is currently First mile where a novice user should be able to trade their Native currency for BitCoin (native currency to BTC), Transfer of funds (BTC sender to BTC recipient), and Last Mile (BTC to native currency). </p>

<p>
	To an end user, the experience would be as simple as :
	An ideal use case is you go onto a site, put in your relatives mobile phone number, your credit card number (or direct deposit to save 3%), and money and frequency of sending, and the site takes care of the rest. </p>

<h5>New Cost structure under Bitcoin system</h5>
<p>
	As of May 7 Bid/Ask spread of USD to MXP is 
</br>
	<table> <tr> <td>Bid:</td><td>	15.3049 </td> </tr>
	<tr> <td>Ask:</td><td>	15.3066</td> </tr></table>
</br>
	This gives a cost of transaction 1 bip/2. This is because cost is calculated by (Bid - Ask)/(2 * Market). The larger the size of the transaction, the wider the investment bank's trading desk increases the spread. A bitcoin remittance company would want to avoid exposure to movements in underlying currency, so would aim to settle transactions immediately. 
</br>
	Your spread is transaction cost (assuming only bid/ask spread and no other fees) .01-.00011 = .00989 = 99 bips is profit margin. If you charged Western Union rates which is  so 1 bip. 
</br>

	Currently with existing remittance networks, the average remittance size is $200/month charging 4.75%. Assuming your cost is only 1 bip you can significantly undercut Western Union. Of course this does not include the cost of infrastructure, marketing, support, charge contesting, etc.

<h4>Financial Impact</h4>
	<p>

	If 1 company decides to pursue to bring all steps of the process in house, and provide first mile all the way to last mile services (highest potential profits), then due to the nature of remittance flows, there will be a net currency imbalance, with a surplus of sender currency, and deficit of receiver currency. 
</p>

<p>
	E.g.

		As of 2013, the USA to Mexico remittance market was $21.6 billion. Let's break down an example of potential profits as a full service remittance provider (first to last mile).
</br>
		If as a service provider you were to capture 1% of the USA to Mexico remittance market, by providing services from between US dollars and Mexican pesos, and the net remittance transfer from 2013 was $21.6 billion, you would end up with $216 million dollars in USD cash, and 3.3 billion mexican pesos in cash dispensed. 
</br>
		Assuming you charged a 1% transaction fee. 
</br>
		In order to balance your books, you would need to be a participant in the forex market to transfer those USD to Pesos (so they go from your USD account receivable to your Mexican account payable).

<h4>
Proposed Business Idea to Mitigate Financial Impact</h4>
<p>
A company that manages your sending and receving account balance. This would work by trading your balance such that whenever you generate enough of a surplus in your hedge account.
